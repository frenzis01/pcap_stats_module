# ipt_geofence Performance Evaluation - Python stats module

Python script made _ad hoc_ to calculate some stats on given .pcap files.

Its sole purpose was to be used in a University project (soon available), it is publicly available here only in relation to this latter one and for the sake of completeness.

It has _not_ been made by keeping in mind code reusability principles. This is a first and rough approach to python, its development was driven by our specific needs.

## Stats

About the script itself, it has proven to be useful to quickly get _ipt_geofence_ elaboration time **T<sub>e**, its **variance** and the **pps** rate of the host running _ipt_geofence_.
